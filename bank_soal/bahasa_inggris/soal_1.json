    "pertanyaan": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked considerable debate about its potential impact on the future of work. While some envision a dystopian future where robots replace human labor en masse, leading to widespread unemployment, others argue that AI will primarily augment human capabilities, creating new jobs and increasing productivity. Proponents of the latter view suggest that repetitive, manual tasks are most susceptible to automation, freeing up humans to focus on more creative, complex, and interpersonal roles. However, the transition will likely not be seamless. Significant investment in reskilling and upskilling programs will be crucial to ensure a smooth adaptation for the workforce. Furthermore, ethical considerations regarding AI's decision-making processes and potential biases must be addressed to ensure a fair and equitable integration into society.\n\nWhat is the main topic of the passage?",
