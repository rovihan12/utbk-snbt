    "pertanyaan": "The increasing popularity of plant-based diets reflects a growing awareness of their potential benefits for both human health and environmental sustainability. Studies suggest that such diets can reduce the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. From an ecological perspective, plant-based eating typically has a smaller carbon footprint, requires less land and water, and contributes less to deforestation compared to meat-heavy diets. However, careful planning is essential to ensure adequate intake of all necessary nutrients, such as Vitamin B12 and iron, which are more readily available in animal products. Education and access to diverse plant-based options are key to facilitating this dietary shift.\n\nWhat is one of the potential health benefits of plant-based diets mentioned in the passage?",
