    "pertanyaan": "Read the following text to answer question number 1 to 5.\n\n**Text 1**\n\nPlastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental issues, with rapidly increasing production of disposable plastic products overwhelming the world's ability to deal with them. Plastic pollution is most visible in developing Asian and African nations, where garbage collection systems are often inefficient or nonexistent. But the developed world, especially in countries with low recycling rates, also has trouble properly collecting discarded plastics. Plastic trash is now so ubiquitous it has prompted efforts to write a global treaty negotiated by the United Nations.\n\nPlastics often contain additives making them stronger, more flexible, and durable. But many of these additives can extend the life of products if they become litter, with some estimates ranging to at least 400 years to break down. How plastics are made also is an energy-intensive process that relies heavily on fossil fuels. It's estimated that 4 percent of the world's annual petroleum production is diverted to making plastic, and another 4 percent gets burned in the process.\n\nFurthermore, the impact of plastic waste on marine life is devastating. Millions of marine animals and seabirds die each year from ingesting plastic or becoming entangled in it. Microplastics, tiny plastic particles resulting from the breakdown of larger items, have infiltrated the entire ocean food chain and have even been found in drinking water and human food sources, raising significant concerns about human health impacts. This pervasive contamination highlights the urgent need for comprehensive solutions that address the entire lifecycle of plastic products.\n\nWhat is the main idea of the passage?",

    "pertanyaan": "Read the following text to answer question number 6 to 10.\n\n**Text 2**\n\nThe human microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms living in and on our bodies. These microbial communities, which include bacteria, fungi, and viruses, play crucial roles in human health, influencing everything from digestion to immune function. Recent research has revealed that a diverse microbiome is associated with better health outcomes, while reduced microbial diversity has been linked to various conditions including obesity, autoimmune diseases, and mental health disorders.\n\nAntibiotics, while life-saving medicines, can significantly disrupt the gut microbiome by killing both harmful and beneficial bacteria. Studies show that it can take weeks or even months for the microbiome to recover after a course of antibiotics, and sometimes it never fully returns to its original state. This has led researchers to investigate ways to protect and restore healthy gut flora, including the use of probiotics and prebiotics.\n\nMoreover, dietary choices significantly influence microbiome composition. High-fiber diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, while highly processed foods can negatively affect microbial diversity. Fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, and kimchi naturally contain probiotics that can help maintain a healthy gut ecosystem. Understanding these dietary connections offers promising avenues for improving overall health through targeted nutritional strategies that support our microbial partners.\n\nWhat is the main idea of the passage?",

    "pertanyaan": "Read the following text to answer question number 11 to 15.\n\n**Text 3**\n\nArtificial Intelligence has transformed from a theoretical concept to a practical tool impacting numerous industries. Machine learning algorithms now power recommendation systems, voice assistants, and autonomous vehicles. However, as AI systems become more sophisticated, concerns about ethics, bias, and job displacement have grown substantially.\n\nOne significant challenge is algorithmic bias, where AI systems perpetuate or even amplify existing societal prejudices. This occurs because these systems learn from historical data that may contain biased human decisions. For instance, hiring algorithms trained on data from companies that historically favored male candidates might learn to discriminate against female applicants. Addressing these issues requires diverse development teams, transparent algorithms, and ongoing monitoring.\n\nLooking forward, the regulation of artificial intelligence presents another complex challenge. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to foster innovation while protecting citizens from potential harms. The European Union has proposed comprehensive AI regulations that classify systems by risk level and impose stricter requirements on high-risk applications. Similarly, other nations are developing their own frameworks to ensure AI develops in an ethical and socially beneficial manner, creating a complex patchwork of international standards that companies must navigate.\n\nThe passage mainly discusses...",

    "pertanyaan": "Read the following text to answer question number 16 to 20.\n\n**Text 4**\n\nRemote work has transitioned from a niche practice to a mainstream work arrangement, accelerated significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic. While many employees appreciate the flexibility and elimination of commute times, research shows mixed impacts on productivity and wellbeing. Some studies indicate increased productivity due to fewer office distractions, while others note challenges with collaboration, communication, and work-life boundaries.\n\nOrganizations are adopting hybrid models that combine remote and in-office work. Successful implementation requires thoughtful policies regarding communication protocols, performance measurement, and technological infrastructure. Companies must also address potential inequities that may arise, as remote work opportunities are not equally distributed across industries, job types, and demographic groups.\n\nAdditionally, the environmental implications of widespread remote work are significant. Reduced daily commuting has led to decreased traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions in many urban areas. However, these environmental gains may be partially offset by increased residential energy use as people spend more time working from home. The net environmental impact depends on factors such as local energy sources, commuting distances, and housing efficiency, presenting both opportunities and challenges for sustainable urban planning in a post-pandemic world.\n\nThe author's primary purpose in this passage is to...",
