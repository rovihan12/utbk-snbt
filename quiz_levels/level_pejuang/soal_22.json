These immersive virtual worlds enable users to create avatars, own digital assets, and participate in social and economic activities through persistent 3D spaces. The boundaries between physical and digital realities are becoming increasingly blurred as these technologies advance.\n\nDigital identity in the metaverse extends beyond traditional profile information to include behavioral data, social connections, and virtual possessions. This comprehensive digital footprint raises significant questions about privacy, security, and personal autonomy. Users must navigate complex decisions about self-representation while platforms collect vast amounts of sensitive personal information through interactions and transactions.\n\nRegulatory frameworks struggle to address the unique challenges posed by metaverse identities. Issues of digital inheritance, cross-platform identity portability, and protection against identity theft require novel legal approaches. As metaverse adoption grows, developing standards for digital identity management that prioritize user control and security becomes increasingly critical for sustainable ecosystem development.\n\nWhat is the main idea of the passage?",
