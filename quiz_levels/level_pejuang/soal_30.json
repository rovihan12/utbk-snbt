Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can now translate neural signals into digital commands, enabling direct communication between biological and artificial systems. This technology holds transformative potential for medical applications, particularly for individuals with paralysis or neurological disorders.\n\nThe ethical implications of neurotechnology extend far beyond medical applications. As BCIs become more sophisticated, questions arise about cognitive privacy, mental autonomy, and the potential for unauthorized access to neural data. The ability to read, interpret, and potentially influence brain activity raises fundamental questions about human identity and free will in an increasingly connected world.\n\nRegulatory bodies face the challenge of balancing innovation with protection of fundamental human rights. Guidelines for informed consent, data security, and equitable access must evolve alongside technological capabilities. International cooperation is essential to establish standards that prevent misuse while encouraging beneficial applications of these powerful technologies across global societies.\n\nThe passage mainly discusses...",
