    "pertanyaan": "Read the following text to answer the question.\n\n**Text**\n\nUrbanization is a global phenomenon characterized by the increasing concentration of populations in cities and metropolitan areas. This trend brings both opportunities and challenges for sustainable development. Cities serve as engines of economic growth, innovation, and cultural exchange, offering improved access to education, healthcare, and employment.\n\nHowever, rapid urbanization often strains infrastructure and public services. Housing shortages, traffic congestion, air pollution, and inadequate waste management are common problems in fast-growing cities. These challenges disproportionately affect vulnerable populations and can exacerbate social inequalities if not properly managed.\n\nSmart city technologies offer potential solutions to these urban challenges. Through data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and efficient resource management, cities can optimize transportation systems, reduce energy consumption, and improve public services. Successful urban planning requires balancing economic development with environmental protection and social equity to create livable, resilient cities for all residents.\n\nWhat is the main topic of the passage?",
