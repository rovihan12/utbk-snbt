As society becomes increasingly dependent on digital platforms, individuals need these skills to participate fully in social, economic, and educational activities.\n\nThe digital divide remains a significant challenge, with disparities in access to technology and digital skills between different socioeconomic groups, ages, and geographic regions. This gap can exacerbate existing inequalities, limiting opportunities for those without adequate digital literacy. Educational institutions play a crucial role in addressing this issue by integrating digital skills into their curricula from an early age.\n\nMoreover, digital literacy now includes critical thinking about online information.
