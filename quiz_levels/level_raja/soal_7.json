    "pertanyaan": "Read the following text to answer the question.\n\n**Text**\n\nRenewable energy has emerged as a crucial solution in the global effort to combat climate change. Solar and wind power, in particular, have experienced remarkable growth due to technological advancements and decreasing costs. Many countries are now investing heavily in these clean energy sources to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe transition to renewables also brings economic benefits, creating numerous jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. However, challenges remain, particularly in energy storage and grid reliability. Solar and wind power are intermittent by nature, requiring effective battery systems and smart grid technologies to ensure consistent power supply.\n\nDespite these challenges, the future of renewable energy appears promising. Innovations in energy storage, such as improved battery technologies and green hydrogen production, are addressing the intermittency issue. Many experts believe that with continued investment and policy support, renewable energy could supply the majority of the world's electricity within the next few decades, significantly contributing to global decarbonization efforts.\n\nWhat is the main idea of the passage?",
